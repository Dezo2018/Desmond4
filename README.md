Templates and code for the Stelligent Nu onboarding material

## Instructions

Briefly:

1. Click "Use this template" on GitHub to create your repository
1. Make a local clone of that repo.
1. Work through the READMEs in each subdirectory.

Each subdirectory is its own topic. They're numbered so that you can progress
through them in a logical order. Later lessons will build on previous ones.

Within each topic's README, you will find a series of lessons and labs.
As you go through them, save any code you write: scripts, templates, policy
documents, etc. Add them to your copy of this repo. Answer questions inline
using the Markdown quote prefix ("> ") to identify your own additions to the
README files.

When you're ready for review with your mentor, push your changes to your
GitHub account and review your code together.

## Audience

This is a series of lessons originally written for new Associate Engineers at
Stelligent. Full Engineers should work through them as well, but skim through
topics that you know well and skip the labs where you won't gain new experience.

The goal of this material is to prepare all of our engineers for their first
engagements as Stelligent engineers. Any topic or principal presented here
is part of our technical knowledge baseline: this is what we consider a
Minimum Viable Engineer. There are a _lot_ of other ideas and technologies
that you'll come across and need to know in your client engagements.
We can't fit it all in, though, and these are the essentials.

## Materials

You'll find a handful of ways we present each topic. Most of the technical
exercises are labs, where we want you to gain a surface level of exposure to
a variety of AWS services and their most common or compelling features.

Labs within a lesson build on each other. Many lessons require the experience
of previous lessons. Unless you're completely blocked, work through them in
order.

When we provide materials for a lab -- e.g. CloudFormation templates or
policy files -- start with those and add to them as requested. Be sure to
commit and push all your changes so you can review them with your mentor.

Some topics also include retrospectives. These aren't always focused so much
on a technical exercise. Our goal here is usually to get you to think more
broadly about the technology at hand. Take time to discuss these with your
mentor.

We also provide further reading for each topic. Find time to explore some of
these materials more deeply. Pursue your curiosity. There are many excellent
resources out there, and we particularly want you to learn more where the topics
match up with your interests.
